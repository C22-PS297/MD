For Mobile Development, the first that we make is the design of the application. For the design, we need to research common things from the application that we make. With that, we can decide about the feature and other things that are important to have in the application. For designing the interface, we use the Figma platform. After that, we implement those to the application with the Android Studio Platform and used the Kotlin programming language. At the development of the application, we also used API that makes by our Cloud Computing member for authentication.Next step, we merge the application with the model made by our Machine Learning member. The model that we make is to scan a book and group it to its classification. Because of that, we added the Camera X library to access a camera from the client device.
